"""DCP (Decode Context Parallelism) attention for MLA: the head gather and
the log-sum-exp merge that bracket the sharded attention call.

The MLA counterpart of `cp_attention.py`.

Every collective runs on tensors already in torch's hands, outside
the exported op.

Each DCP rank stores a shard of the KV cache, so it can only produce a
*partial* attention result.

  1. `all_gather_heads` widens this rank's query head slice to the whole
     group's heads, so every rank's heads are attended against every rank's
     KV shard.
  2. the kernel runs against this rank's shard alone, returning a partial
     output and its log-sum-exp.
  3. `merge_lse_partials_scatter_heads` folds the partials into the exact
     whole-context result and narrows the head axis back to this rank's own.
